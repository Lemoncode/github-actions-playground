# Approval Protection

* Branch protections (Settings > Branches > Add branch protection rule)
  * Required reviews (Require a pull request before merging > Require approvals)
  * Require conversation resolution before merging (all conversations in PR must be resolved before merging PR)

With GitHub Free plan you can only protect branches on public repositories.
