# Running Multiple Jobs

In this demo we will set up multiple jobs in the same workflow. By now we're running a single job that is doing the the build and also is running the unit tests, let's split it into two different jobs.

Let's merge the previous pull request `added-basic-workflow`, and create a new branch.

* Visit the project page and merge `added-basic-workflow` and delete it.

```bash
git checkout main
```
